#Watermark Drag and Drop

## What does this program do?
This program will let the user drag and drop their images to wherever they desire on any photo or drawing uploaded! The program will also open the window to the set dimensions of the desired image.

## How does it work?
Very simply put, you place your desired images and thumbnail within the correct folders, modify the code to open your specific images, and then the program will open a window the size of your drawing and allow you to drag and drop your thumbnail wherever you desire! Once you're done you can export and close the window by pressing 'E'

The main function I wanted to show off in this project was mainly the drag and drop feature. I was able to do this by using pygame and the features of pygame.MOUSEBUTTOWNDOWN and pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP so the user can click and move their image around. 

## Demonstration
Here is a quick demonstration of my program!
